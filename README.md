- `/tuition/`  
  Includes normalization scripts for tuition fees (e.g. conversion to EUR per semester).

- `/notebooks/`  
  Jupyter Notebooks used for keyword mapping, course enrichment and validation logic (e.g. fuzzy matching).

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)
3. Run scrapers individually per university
4. Use merge scripts to combine the data
5. Use Notebooks to validate, enrich and analyze
