- `/tuition/`  
  Includes normalization scripts for tuition fees.

- `/notebooks/`  
  Jupyter Notebooks used for data cleaning, geolocations and keyword mapping, course enrichment and validation logic.  

- `/data/`  
  Contains datasets, including the cleaned tuition file and the unified program dataset.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)  
3. Run scrapers individually per university  
4. Use merge scripts to combine the data  
5. Use notebooks to validate, enrich and analyze
