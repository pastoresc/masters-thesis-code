Initially, IoT focused on adding connectivity to everyday objects, e.g., one of the earliest examples of IoT devices was a vending machine that could be accessed over the Internet. In recent years, however, the vision has evolved from mere connectivity into the provisioning of a global platform where devices are not merely passive objects as part of the Internet, but active contributors, e.g., through computational capabilities, sensors, or other functionality. The Introduction to IoT course provides an overview of this exciting field, the different components within Iot applications, and the key enablers within the field.
The course consists of six chapters, each addressing IoT from different viewpoints:

Initially, IoT focused on adding connectivity to everyday objects, e.g., one of the earliest examples of IoT devices was a vending machine that could be accessed over the Internet. In recent years, however, the vision has evolved from mere connectivity into the provisioning of a global platform where devices are not merely passive objects as part of the Internet, but active contributors, e.g., through computational capabilities, sensors, or other functionality. The Introduction to IoT course provides an overview of this exciting field, the different components within Iot applications, and the key enablers within the field.
The course consists of six chapters, each addressing IoT from different viewpoints:
1. Introduction to the Internet of Things (IoT)

The primary objective of this course is to help students understand how this profound transformation has occurred, addressing both the hardware and software aspects involved in the process. This evolution has turned computing into a commodity available from big companies to SMEs. However, where there is light, there are also shadows. We are now at a turning point, and major organizations are beginning to recognize that not all cloud infrastructure locations provided by the leading providers could be equally reliable or secure. Factors such as geopolitics and rising service costs driven by energy prices (and the required new type of hardware, such as GPUs), among others, have led many companies to reconsider their confidence in public cloud solutions. The second objective of this course is to encourage students to reflect on this situation and its implications. Moreover, with advances in artificial intelligence (AI)¿particularly generative models¿many companies are starting to require their own IT infrastructures to train AI models with specific data, thereby maintaining security, confidentiality, and complete control over their models. This trend, referred to as the repatriation of workloads to private (or hybrid) infrastructures, is transforming the cloud computing ecosystem. The third focus of this course will explore how AI is accelerating this shift. For this reason, the 2025 edition of this course will build upon a mature and stable public cloud, now considered more of a commercial product than an innovative technology, to delve deeper into the new private IT infrastructures. Emphasis will be placed on the hardware and software supporting the most demanding AI applications and how to program and optimize these systems. We will also see under the hood understanding how high-performance requirements of AI apps are met. The practical component is a fundamental part of this course. The ""learn by doing"" methodology will be applied, with a set of hands-on exercises that students will complete throughout the course. Assessment will be continuous, encouraging steady and consistent work. Teamwork and a ""learn to learn"" approach will be promoted through the reading and presentation of related topics in short presentations, with the aim of equipping students to adapt to and anticipate emerging technologies. The two weekly classes will combine lectures, student presentations, and practical sessions. Students are expected to bring their laptops to every class to follow digital materials or complete assigned hands-on tasks (actually in the same-day class). Attendance is mandatory; students who cannot commit to attending all sessions should not enroll in this course. For the 2025 edition, classes will be conducted in Spanish and Catalan, while all written materials and documentation will be provided in English.","This subject has not requirements, but it has got previous capacities"

So, we will fist consider the the kind of problems that typically appear in organizations not structurally integrated, and proposals that contribute to a better integration of business, mainly the definition and implementation of business processes, transversal to the classical cross functional areas. We will then see how organizations have been developing and implementing new information systems as a fundamental tool for their structural and informational integration, and as a means for their progress in terms of their functional management and its strategic direction, in other words their progress in quality and competitiveness. Along this line, we will then get in-depth in the various integrating roles that companies seek through the main types of enterprise information systems that have been implemented in recent years, from ERP systems to BI systems, through CRM and SCM, as well as EAI projects. As a continuation of that seen in the previous course ""Fundamentals of Information Systems"" (FSI), we will study more in-depth the purposes, similarities and differences between these systems, and among their implementation projects.","This subject has not requirements, but it has got previous capacities"

The second objective of this course is to encourage students to reflect on this situation and its implications. Moreover, with advances in artificial intelligence (AI)¿particularly generative models¿many companies are starting to require their own IT infrastructures to train AI models with specific data, thereby maintaining security, confidentiality, and complete control over their models. This trend, referred to as the repatriation of workloads to private (or hybrid) infrastructures, is transforming the cloud computing ecosystem. The third focus of this course will explore how AI is accelerating this shift. For this reason, the 2025 edition of this course will build upon a mature and stable public cloud, now considered more of a commercial product than an innovative technology, to delve deeper into the new private IT infrastructures. Emphasis will be placed on the hardware and software supporting the most demanding AI applications and how to program and optimize these systems. We will also see under the hood understanding how high-performance requirements of AI apps are met. The practical component is a fundamental part of this course. The ""learn by doing"" methodology will be applied, with a set of hands-on exercises that students will complete throughout the course. Assessment will be continuous, encouraging steady and consistent work. Teamwork and a ""learn to learn"" approach will be promoted through the reading and presentation of related topics in short presentations, with the aim of equipping students to adapt to and anticipate emerging technologies. The two weekly classes will combine lectures, student presentations, and practical sessions. Students are expected to bring their laptops to every class to follow digital materials or complete assigned hands-on tasks (actually in the same-day class). Attendance is mandatory; students who cannot commit to attending all sessions should not enroll in this course. For the 2025 edition, classes will be conducted in Spanish and Catalan, while all written materials and documentation will be provided in English.","This subject has not requirements, but it has got previous capacities"

If not, all the theoretical guarantees become void and the empirical performance may deteriorate dramatically. But what if we want to design an algorithm for playing chess? The opponent is not going to sample the moves from a fixed distribution.
 Online and reinforcement learning break out of the static realm and move into the realm of perpetual cycle of getting new information, analysing it, and executing actions based on the updated estimation of reality. We consider agents (computer programs, robots, living beings) learning based on interactions with (real or simulated) environments. Examples include problems like repeated investment in the stock market, spam filtering, online advertising, online routing, medical treatments, games, and robotics. It allows to model a much richer range of problems, including problems with limited feedback, problems with delayed feedback, and even adversarial problems, where the environment deliberately acts against the algorithm (as, for example, in chess or spam filtering). At the same time it stimulates the development of fascinating mathematical tools for developing and analyzing algorithms for these problems.
In the course we will cover:
The notion of regret: the evaluation measure, which replaces generalization error in offline learning and makes it possible to define and analyse learning in adversarial environments
Various forms of feedback, including full-information and limited [bandit] feedback

Such architectures are however capricious; unlocking their power requires understanding their design principles and also specialised knowledge of code transformations, for example, aimed at optimising locality of reference, the degree of parallelism, etc. As such, this course is organised into three tracks: hardware, software, and lab.
 
The Software Track teaches how to think parallel. We introduce the map-reduce functional programming model, which builds programs naturally, like puzzles, from a nested composition of implicitly-parallel array operators, which are rooted in the mathematical structure of list homomorphisms. We reason about the asymptotic (work and depth) properties of such programs and discuss the flattening transformation, which converts (all) arbitrarily-nested parallelism to a more-restricted form that can be directly mapped to the hardware. We then turn our attention to legacy-sequential code written in programming languages such as C. In this context we study dependence analysis, as a tool for reasoning about loop-based optimisations (e.g., Is it safe to execute a given loop in parallel, or to interchange two loops?). As time permits, we may cover more advanced topics, for example, related to dynamic analysis for optimising locality of reference.
 The Hardware Track studies the design space of the critical components of parallel hardware: processor, memory hierarchy and interconnect networks.  We will find out that modern hardware design is governed by old ideas, which are merely adjusted or combined in different ways.
 The Lab Track applies the theory learned in the other tracks. We will review the fundamental ideas that govern the GPGPU design and potential performance bottlenecks.  We will quickly learn several parallel-programming models, and we will get our hands dirty by putting in practice the optimisations learned in the software track. We will use (the in-house developed) Futhark to write nested-parallel programs, to demonstrate flattening, and as a baseline. We will use OpenMP and CUDA to write ""parallel-assembly"" code for multi-core and GPGPU execution, respectively.

Knowledge of
The types and semantics of data-parallel operators.
Analyses for identifying and optimising parallelism and locality of reference, e.g., flattening, dependence analysis.
The main hardware-design techniques for supporting parallelism at processor, memory hierarchy and interconnect levels.
 Skills in
Implementing parallel programs in high-level (Futhark) and lower-level programming models (OpenMP, CUDA).
Applying (by hand) the flattening transformation on specific instances of data-parallel programs.
Applying (by hand) various ""imperative"" code transformations (such as loop interchange, loop distribution, block and register tiling) for optimising the degree of parallelism and locality of reference.
Testing, measuring the impact of applied optimisations and characterising the performance of parallel programs.

Yet these marvellous devices are, at the core, amazingly simple and stupid: all they can do is to mechanically shuffle zeros and ones around. What is the true potential of such automated computational devices? And what are the limits of what can be done by mechanical calculations?
Complexity theory gives these deep and fascinating philosophical questions a crisp mathematical meaning. A computational problem is any task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer—i.e., it can be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps. Complexity theory focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and on relating those classes of problems to each other. The goal is to understand the power of computers but also—and above all—the limitations of what problems can be solved by them, or more broadly by any type of automated computational process. A problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires unreasonably large resources regardless of which approach is used to solve it (i.e., no matter which algorithm is employed). Complexity theory formalizes this notion by introducing mathematical models of computation and quantifying the amount of resources needed to solve the problems, such as running time, memory usage, parallelism, communication, et cetera.
This course will give an introduction to computational complexity theory, survey some of the major research results, and present some of the open problems that are the focus of current research.
